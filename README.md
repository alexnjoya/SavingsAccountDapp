# Token Stacking Dapp - Problem Statement and Solution

## Problem Statement

In the ever-evolving realm of decentralized finance (DeFi), users face several challenges when seeking secure and straightforward platforms for stacking their tokens and earning rewards. These challenges include:

1. **Complexity**: Existing DeFi platforms can be intimidating for beginners due to their intricate processes and terminology, making it challenging for novices to participate in token stacking.

2. **Security Concerns**: Security is a paramount concern in the DeFi space. Users are often hesitant to engage with smart contracts due to potential vulnerabilities and scams, leading to a lack of trust in the ecosystem.

3. **Limited Token Options**: Many DeFi platforms offer only a limited selection of tokens for stacking, limiting users' diversification options and investment strategies.

4. **Lack of Transparency**: Users frequently struggle to track their stacked tokens and rewards in real-time, causing a lack of trust in the system and its processes.
